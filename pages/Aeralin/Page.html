                Aeralins are typically quiet, but overall very nice people to hang out with.They come off as dry at first but once you get to know them, they're very social and tou can't help but love them. They enjoy roughhousing a bit but overall they are the sweetest and more girls you'll ever meet. They don't usually stand out much despite their extreme beauty. They're nice, reliable, and loyal, so if you meet one, don't miss the oppurtunity.
