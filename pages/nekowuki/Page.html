                NekoWiki is a wikipeda desigend and created by Wonkey in 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason this web wikipeda was created was to combat the issue of <a href="../wikipedia/Page.html">Wikipeda</a> not being trust-worthy to a lot of people, and secondly, so that he could get lazy and use this as one of his sources.
            </p>    <!-- He, as in me. -->
            <p>A very much <b>"Source? Trust me bro."</b> moment.</p>
